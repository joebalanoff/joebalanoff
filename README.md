## About Me:

Hello! My name is Joe and I am an amateur game developer and Discord bot developer and I live in the US. You can check out some of my projects below:

## Projects:

- [Quingee Bot](https://github.com/NomadApplications/QuingeeBot): Custom Discord bot made for knvoa. Built in currency, shop, seasons, etc.. Check the repo for more info.
- [EasyDiscord](https://github.com/NomadApplications/EasyDiscord): NPM package for beginners to make Discord bots in v13.
- [Uno in Discord](https://github.com/NomadApplications/uno-in-discord): Replication of the popular game Uno in Discord v13 with buttons and slash commands with DB leaderboard.

## Contact Me:

You can contact me on Discord at @Joe.#5555 (preferred) or at my email, joebalanoff@gmail.com. I will respond within the day (if not I'm probably out of cell reception, pretty spotty around where I live)!

## Programming Experience:

I am completely self taught in various languages; Java, Javascript, Node.js, C#, Python 2 & 3, and (might be controversial) HTML & CSS. I primarily use Node.js since it's what I use to make Discord bots. My secondary language is C#. This is the language that I make all of my games in. I work mostly in Unity, but I have also made some custom engines in Java and C++.
