<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Joe and I am an amateur game developer and Discord bot developer and I live in the US. You can check out some of my projects below:</p>
<h2>Some projects I have (or am currently) working on:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NomadApplications/QuingeeBot">Quingee Bot</a>: Custom Discord bot made for knvoa. Built in currency, shop, seasons, etc.. Check the repo for more info.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NomadApplications/Nomad-SlashCommands">Nomad-Slashcommands</a>: Custom NPM package to easily create Slash Commands. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Contact me</h1>
<p>You can contact me on Discord at @Joe.#5555 (preferred) or at my email, joebalanoff@gmail.com. I will respond within the day (if not I'm probably out of cell reception, pretty spotty around where I live). I do take commissions but for Discord bots please join our (Nomad Apps) <a href="https://discord.gg/6Ysz3cK43U">Discord server</a>.</p> 

<h1>Programming Experience</h1>
<p>I am completely self taught in various languages; Java, Javascript, Node.js, C#, Python 2 & 3, Lua, and Kotlin.</p>
<p>I primarily use Node.js since it's what we (Nomad Apps) use for making Discord bots.<p>
<p>My secondary language is C#. This is the language that I make all of my games in. I work mostly in Unity, but I have also made some custom engines in Java and C++.</p>
